A tutorial that I developed as a student from <a href=[https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication)>The Odin Project</a> to learn about Authentication using Devise.
<br><br>
## Description
This application is focused on getting the main funcionalities of a athentication system going, with a simple layout.
this application was made using <a href= [https://github.com/heartcombo/devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)> Devise</a> and <a href=[https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form)>simple_form</a>.
<br><br>
## Run it

<br><br>
## Conclusion
This project was great and fullfiled it's role, i've seen first hand how to use Forms and Authentication to build a fully working app! with all authentication  funcionalities. Devise is a pretty powerfull tool that i'm excited to be working with again!
